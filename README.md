This repository showcases a collection of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) policies that I have drafted to
demonstrate practical cybersecurity expertise. Each Document reflects  my ability to intrepret regulatory
requirements, apply industy frameworks such as NIST, ISO 27001, and CIS controls, and translate them into 
accountable policies. Polices span accross different areas such as Zero Trust architecture, cloud governance, threat
intelligence and data protection. These are designed to be adaptable accross sectors and align with operational 
realities.
By sharing these sample policies, I aim to highlight my stragetic thinking, technical writing skills, and commitment
to ethical cybersecurity leadership. These policies are not just theoretical; they represent real-world applications
of compliance principles, and dialogue with professionals who are equally passionate about advanceing cybersecurity
governcance and resilience.
